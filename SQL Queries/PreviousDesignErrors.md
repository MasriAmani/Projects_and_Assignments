The first problem is that I dont have a primary key that defines each instructor uniquely.
Second problem is that I have in each of the degree field three values seperated by comma which is not correct each field must represent one value.
Third problem is having three columns for the degrees (degree 1 ,degree2 ,degree3 ) so if the instructor has only one degree then
the other two columns will be null so we might have a lot of null values.
